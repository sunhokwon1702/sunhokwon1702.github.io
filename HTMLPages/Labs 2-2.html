        <h2>Your Five Business Introduction Rules</h2>
        <ol type="1">
        <li><strong>Stand Up:</strong>When you are seasted and someone approaches you to say "hello" with a handshake, stand up, whether you are a man or woman. By doing so, you show the person you are gretting that they are worth your full attention.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Eye Contact:</strong>By looking someone directly in the eye, you accomplish three thing:</li>
        <ul style="list-style: square">
            <li>You will project an image of self-confidence and a healthy self-esteem.</li>
            <li>You will be perceived as a good listener.</li>
            <li>You will probably receive the same courtesy when you speak.</li>
            </ul>
        <li><strong>Smile:</strong>It sends others a message of acceptance.</li>
        <li><strong>Say Your Name:</strong>If you are meeting someone for the first time you should itnroduce yourself using your first and last name.</li>
        <li><strong>Shake Hands:</strong>Generally speaking, a handshake should last onlyh as long as it takes to greet the person. It should be firm enough to display our sense of confidence without being a bonecrusher.</li></ol>
        <h2>Creating a BAD First Impression</h2>
        <ul style="list-style: circle">
        <li><strong>Sloppy Language:</strong>No matter how well you dress, using sloppy language will lesson your credibility with others. For example saying "yeah" instead of "yes", or using rpfanity, especailly around people that would not find it impressive. Most people consider your choice of words a direct reflection on your intelligence.</li>
        <li><strong>Giggling:</strong>While laughter can be the best medicine for many ills, giggling can be annoying.</li>
        <li><strong>HIdding your Hands:</strong>Believe it or not, etiquette research has shown that hands above borad are more appealing than hands hidden away in pockets. When your hands are not showing, it often sends a signal to someone that you are not telling all or that you are holding something back.</li>
        <li><strong>Gum-Chewing:</strong>Let there be no doubt about it, you should not chew gum when meeting people. No exceptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Throat Clearing:</strong>The habit of clearing your throat several times during a converstaion can be very distracting.</li></ul>
